# Question #1


## Deep learning analytical thinking

### Problem description:

In 2024, several UK drivers were wrongly fined up to £105 for failing to pay the Dartford Crossing toll, despite never having used the crossing. The issue stemmed from ANPR cameras misreading vehicle licence plates, leading to incorrect penalty charge notices being issued. For instance, one driver received fines for vehicles with plates differing by a single character from her own, and another was fined for a vehicle of a similar make and color but with a slightly different registration number.

### Assumptions:
- System was being built with a Deep Learning based model (not traditional computer vision methods) 


### Questions:

Please provide a document (and extra data if any) answering each question below; please note that no practical exercises are required here (just theoretical analysis) but feel free to add any.

1. What do you think it occurred during this model development (trainning & evaluation)?

2. How would you fix this behavior? Please provide at least 2 options explaining their pros and drawbacks

3. What do you think it will occur when running this AI in a different country with different plates formats? How would you ensure system accuracy?

4. Do you know any OCR (Optical Character Recognition) algorithms (Deep learning based) that could be used here?
 
5. Explain a Computer Vision / Artificial Intelligence project in which you have participated (goals, your role, difficulties you found, how they were solved, ...)

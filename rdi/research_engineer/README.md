# Research Engineer Test

## What is this test about?
If you are reading this document, then you are in the process of becoming a new member of our team. Like any other company, at Fluendo we are looking for the best talent to join our team, but itâ€™s always hard to do so just by reading a CV or in a 1-hour Q&A interview.

The goal of this test is to understand how you would fit in our Research, Development and Innovation team by simulating the presentation of a prototype for what we call an Innovation Project.

Our team is in charge of the evaluation of new ideas and their potential to become new products, analyzing them from a technical and product perspective. In the product development phases, we are the very beginning of the chain: starting at the spark of an idea (from anyone from the company or from our clients), analyzing its viability and fit into new products and finally creating a prototype of the idea.

The goal of this test is to check your skills in the following topics:

 * You can analyze a new idea from the engineering and product perspective
 * You can synthesize a product idea and present it in a way that it can be easily understood.
 * You can define a prototype idea with the correct scope and budget
 * You can describe a prototype from the product side
 * You can describe a prototype from the technical side
 * You are able to present visually the technical parts of the idea
 * You have experience working on projects starting from scratch
 * You have background in different types of technologies and you are not afraid of learning new ones


## The rules

You will be presenting a prototype for a product idea, where you will provide:
 * A short introduction of the idea and how it fits into the new idea
 * The needs to create a prototype
 * The description of the prototype as functional and non-functional requirements
 * The description of the prototype from a technical view, with an overview of the tech stack to be used and architecture, components or intereactions diagrams to support your description
 * Scope, duration and budget of the prototype

Examples of ideas you could be presenting:

 * An app to share a desktop application in real time with a friend
 * A 360 dashcam for moto drivers that can analise risks and give feedback through a new hardware design
 * A new video encoder doing per-scene encoding using machine learning to improve the quality/bitrate ratio
 * A framework that can convert you into an avatar for video conferences
 * Whatever other idea you have have or you have worked in the past that can help do this test faster

 We will provide you with a Google Slides template with several sections that you will need to fill to guide for your presentation

 Good luck!

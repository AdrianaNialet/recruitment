# Question #2


## Computer Vision knowledge

### Problem description:

In Fluendo we are developing an AI-based system for automatize sport-analysis in order to help experts as coaches or scouts to identify a team's strong & weak points during a game or training session from a set of recorded images/videos.

Typical use-cases:

- Team heat-maps drawing: 

![heat](../imagery/heat.jpg)

- Virtual Assistant referee tools:

![var](../imagery/var.jpg)

- Player action recognition:

![expl](../imagery/expulsion.jpg)





In order to provide these smart functionalities one of the most important milestones is to achieve an accurate **team detection & classification system** which allow us to distinguish players of different teams and discard referees or coaches. 

In this test you will be asked about this last functionality (see below image as reference)

## Test:

### Assumptions:

- Both traditional and modern (Deep Learning) techniques can be proposed

  

### Questions:

Please provide a document (and extra data if any) answering each question below.

1. Which algorithms would you use to achieve this? Please provide at least 2 proposals
2. What do potential bottlenecks may this problem have? (i.e. non-static camera) Just list them (if any)
2.  Could your proposals be scaled to other team-based sports? (i.e. hockey, rugby, ...) Which would be worst-case scenarios?
2. Extra: provide a sample code with some proposal running

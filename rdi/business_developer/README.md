# Research Engineer Test

## What is this test about?
If you are reading this document, then you are in the process of becoming a new member of our team. Like any other company, at Fluendo we are looking for the best talent to join our team, but itâ€™s always hard to do so just by reading a CV or in a 1-hour Q&A interview.

The goal of this test is to understand how you would fit in our Research, Development and Innovation team by simulating the presentation of a strategic plan for what we call an Innovation Project.

Our team is in charge of the evaluation of new ideas and their potential to become new products, analyzing them from a technical and product perspective. In the product development phases, we are the very beginning of the chain: starting at the spark of an idea (from anyone from the company or from our clients), analyzing its viability and fit into new products and finally creating a prototype of the idea.

The goal of this test is to check your skills in the following topics:

 * You can analyze a new idea from the business perspective
 * You can synthesize a business idea and present it in a way that it can be easily understood
 * You can define the target addressable market for the business idea that drives subsequent decision-making about the scope of technical work and the budget
 * You can describe a prototype from the product side
 * You can describe a prototype from the market side
 * You are able to present visually the complex parts of the idea
 * You can prepare a risk assessment and management plan for the business (identify hazards, decide probability and severity, and take action to eliminate or control them)
 * You have experience working on projects starting from scratch
 * You have background in different types of technologies and you are not afraid of learning new ones


## The rules

You will be presenting a prototype for a business idea, where you will provide:
 * A short introduction of what you are doing and why
 * The justifications to invest in this business idea
 * The description of what you are building and for whom 
 * The description of the opportunity from a market perspective, with a business plan based on data, prospecting of clients and competitors, and estimation of target addressable markets 
 * A strategic plan to attract investment, participate in projects with public-private financing, recruit talent, etc.
 * Scope, duration and budget of the business idea

Examples of ideas you could be presenting:

 * An AI-based sports video analysis software
 * A software for low latency streaming from embedded devices with a connected camera
 * Whatever other idea you have have or you have worked in the past that can help do this test faster

 We will provide you with a Google Slides template with several sections that you will need to fill to guide for your presentation

 Good luck!
